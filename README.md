<h1 align="center"> Brain Tic Tac Toe</h1>

[View the live project here](https://elainebroche-dev.github.io/ms1-thrive/)

Brain Tic Tac Toe is a fun game played by two players, the player chooses to be X or O. Some times one can sense the next move by simply looking at the component's impression, by playing with a computer as your component, it's trickier and fun to play with a random move player because you can't see the computer's expressions.

The users of this game improves their virtue and focus skill in due time, because the more you play this game, the better your intellegence improves.

## Features

### Existing Features

-   __Header__

    - The game consists of a logo and the name:  Brain Tic Tac Toe in the center of the header which is good for user interface.
    - The logo and the name of the game clearly tells the user, that the game is for smart people.

-   __Make a choose__

    - The option box tells the player to choose from Prayer(O) or Prayer(O) before the game starts.
    - Once a user chooses a prayer, the game can only begin once the user clicks the button.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __future implementation__
    - I wish the loser could be the first one to play, once a replay button is placed given that on clicking replay one has to select who to be from player-X and player-O which I find tricky for now.

- __predication improvements__
    - When the first player starts from the corner he/she has higher chances of winning the game.
    - I could predict my win or the computer's next move even if it has to be random, not sure if it is just my intuition.

## Design

-   ### View
- It is in the middle of the screen
- the width of the elements is in percentage, so I didn't need to use media query in CSS for it to be responsive 

-   ### Colour Scheme
- black
- violetblue
- white smoke
- green
